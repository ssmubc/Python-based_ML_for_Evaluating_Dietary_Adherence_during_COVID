# ML project: Evaluating Dietary Adherence during COVID

This dataset is based COVID-19 patients data for population count for each country that comes from the Population Reference Bureau. The current version of data include COVID-19 data from the week of 02/06/2021. It includes data for different food group supply quantities, nutrition values, obesity, and undernourished percentages that are obtained from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO website. Data for COVID-19 confirmed, deaths, recovered and active cases are obtained from Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

The USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion recommends a very simple daily diet intake guideline: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10% fruits, and 20% protein, but are we really eating in the healthy eating style recommended by these food divisions and balances?

We will test this proposal
